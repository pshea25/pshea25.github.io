<p>I started playing hockey when I was only four years old, and I've loved it since.  I grew up playing in Massachusetts and ended up playing three years of high school hockey for my hometown.  I then went on to a prep school called Kimball Union, where I played hockey for two years.  I am not playing for The University of Maine.  It has been quite the journey to get here with many ups and downs.  I look forward to what the future holds.  I hope to go on and play in the NHL and achieve my life long dream.</p>

<p>I also enjoy watching hockey.  I grew up as a huge Boston Bruins fan of course, being from massachusetts.  I have a strong memory of them making the stanley cup run in 2011</p>
