<p> Some of my favorite artists that I enjoy listening to are Eminem, J cole, Drake, Mike Stud, Chance the Rapper, and many more.  My all time favorite  that I listen to most is Mike Stud.  This is because I relate to him in a lot of ways, and i can connect to his songs.  He was a college athlete before turning towards music.  He believes in following your passions and doing what you love.  If you believe it can happen, then it will.  I agree with is philosophy.</p>

<p> I have become passionate about making rap music as more of a side hobby.  I started doing this with friends at prep school, and pretty much got addicted to it.  It has become a very fun thing for me to do. I learned a bit over the last couple years, and I even put out an EP.  I did it all by myself.  For only doing it for a couple years, I think it's pretty good. Maybe one day I'll go on tour if I get good enough. You can click the link and listen below</p>
